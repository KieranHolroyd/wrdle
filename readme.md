# WRDLE - The (W.I.P) CLI take on the popular word game.

*CURRENTLY UNPLAYABLE, DO NOT TRY*

A little about me, I'm Kieran and i like to program things, i also like the popular game wordle and i doubt it will be to hard to create a terminal based UI for the game, the word you'll be guessing will be picked pseudo-randomly and will follow the basic rules of the original wordle.

This is going to be a side project for me and as such I don't have a planned end date for a playable version although i hope I will be able to make it rather quickly as from a little research I don't believe it's too difficult to implement the basic features (not that it's particularly easy either), but obviously all credit for the original wordle game, and I wouldn't like to compete with someone's original idea, rather i feel like this is more of a port of the game with the potential to add some features in the future.

Also as this is a CLI game, which should ship as one binary and not a website, the source code is open and you'll be able to see for yourself as the development progresses that there will be no calling home to analytics servers or anything for that matter, much like the original game architecture I plan on adding the list at "compile time", these lists will be gathered from the google books data for popular words over the last century with some light pruning, although I kind of like the idea of a programmer game mode where any 5 letter acronyms can be words, and at the end we give a link to the specific wikipedia page.

If you have any ideas as to how far I should try to go with this project, or possible ideas to implement, or even an implementation itself as i'll likely end up making this project with what will hopefully be a decent plugin esque design for game modes, which will make it very easy to add a new gamemode yourself then upstream it for it to be in the next release.

As I'm writing this I've not written any code for this project, I decided I would like to make this project, checked npm for conflicts, didn't find one and took it for this project in the future, as such pull requests will likely be ignored until I have something you can get up and running with the basic architecture layed out as I have a pretty firm vision for what that will look like, it will just take a minute.
